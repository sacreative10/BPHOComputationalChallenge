  abstract = {Spherical coordinates, also called spherical polar coordinates (Walton 1967, Arfken 1985), are a system of curvilinear coordinates that are natural for describing positions on a sphere or spheroid. Define theta to be the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis with 0{$<$}=theta{$<$}2pi (denoted lambda when referred to as the longitude), phi to be the polar angle (also known as the zenith angle and colatitude, with phi=90 degrees-delta where delta is the latitude) from the positive...},
