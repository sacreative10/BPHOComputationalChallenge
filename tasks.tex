\subsection{Task 1}
We completed this task using a while loop. Our condition was while our current y-coordinate is above 0, we draw the points on screen. Within the loop, we solve for $x$ and $y$ through parametric equations in terms of $t$. Every iteration within the while loop, we add a timestep $dt = 0.01$ and, calculate the coordinates using suvat equations, namely $s_y = u tsin\theta  - 1/2 g t^2$ and $s_x = u cos\theta$, and then render a circle with these coordinates as the radius on screen.

\subsection{Task 2}
To get equally spaced x-coordinates whilst allowing the interative user to pick the number of points in their model, we calculate the range using $x_a = \frac{u^2}{g} sin\theta cos\theta$.


Using the equations on the brief \cite{brief} for task 2,
